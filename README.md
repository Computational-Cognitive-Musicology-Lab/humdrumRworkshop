# humdrumR workshop May 2023
Welcome to the humdrumR workshop at Georgia Tech! 

## Installations
In order to participate in this workshop you will need to install:  

### R (version 4.1 or greater, ideally the newest version which is 4.3) [full documentation instructions here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html)
  * [Windows download here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)  
  * [Mac download here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)  
  * [Linux users visit here for instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html) -- note most users will have it preinstalled  
  
### Rstudio Desktop 
  * [All platforms visit here for download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

### humdrumR!
The full instructions for [installing and setting up humdrumR](https://computational-cognitive-musicology-lab.github.io/humdrumR/#installing-humdrum_mathbbr) are available on our webpage. If for any reason you have difficulties installing humdrumR, please feel free to reach out to the conference organizers for assistance! 

## Data
For simplicity during the workshop, we have curated files from multiple corpora and placed them all here in a single location. As such, please be sure to download all files via a git clone (recommended). 

If you are unfamiliar with cloning repositories from github using git, you can simply manually download the files from the main page and place them all in a convenient folder of your choice. (Note that cloning via git has the advantage of allowing simple updates if files are changed or added after you originally download.) To download, navigate to the green ``code'' button on the home page and under the dropdown you will see a download.zip option:
