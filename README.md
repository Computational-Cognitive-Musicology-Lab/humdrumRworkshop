## Data
For simplicity during the workshop, we have curated files from multiple corpora and placed them all here in a single location. As such, please be sure to download all files via a git clone (recommended). 

If you are unfamiliar with cloning repositories from github using git, you can simply manually download the files from the main page and place them all in a convenient folder of your choice. (Note that cloning via git has the advantage of allowing simple updates if files are changed or added after you originally download.) To download, navigate to the green ``code'' button on the home page and under the dropdown you will see a download.zip option:
